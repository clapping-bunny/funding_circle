# Visualisations and analysis of the funding circle Loan book

This project will look at the [funding circle](fundingcircle.co.uk) loanbook, visualising it and analysising various strategies. I also aim to develop a shiny interface for analysising personal loanbooks against the complete dataset.

To repeat the analysis you will need:
   - A copy of R
   - Your personal loanbook as a csv and named personel_loanbook.csv saved at '~/data/Funding_circle'
   - The funding circle loanbook as a csv and named loanbook.csv, saved in the same place as above
   - It is recommended that you use the freely available Rstudio IDE
